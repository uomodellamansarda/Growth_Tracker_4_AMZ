# Growth_Tracker_4_AMZ

As a Self-taught Data Scientist in 2017 I decided that my goal would be to reach the 10.000 hours to be a senior Python engineer. 
I used the pomodoro technique to drive my efforts and I developed a script that helped me to understand where I was going. 
I also conducted a stochastic analysis of the time it would take to reach different levels of expertise. 

This code is made to analyze Pomodoro Techniques Logs and undersand how well Data Science with Python practice is going. 
Practice could be study, no profit project, work.

The goal is to reach 10.000 hours to be an expert. 
It's just a trivial proxy, but gives an idea and a direction and it's enough. 

The code is made to compare: 


*   How I am growing as Python Data Scientist after First Amazon Rejection
*   Setted how time still remains to become an expert based on 10.000 rule
*   2021 Projection with Quarters Forcast and their confidence level

The main plots are attached to this readme, more information are inside the colab, feel free to use as it is. 
If you liked this repo I will be happy to get in touch with you on LinkedIn.
